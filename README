The files' meaning:
./README			/* You are reading this */
./lightbeamData.json		/* merge into this collection one */
./buffer/make_it_private.asc	/* encrypt your data with this public key and push your data into . */
				/* I will merge into the collection by myself */
./buffer/			/* where you _only_ push your encrypted data into */

And that's all, let's build the BIG one ;)
